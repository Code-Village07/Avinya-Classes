<p>As more institutions expand their online learning programs and more educators incorporate interactive learning trends into their lectures, it only makes sense that students also turn to computers and other digital devices and apps for enhancing their learning experience. It is not surprising that out of 88% of students who own a laptop, 63% use it during their classes (McGraw-Hill Education, 2017). In fact, there is an increasing number of school organization apps for note-taking available these days.
   However, while a computer or laptop can help improve learning by allowing students to efficiently research, communicate, and collaborate (McGraw-Hill Education, 2017), these devices may not be as helpful when used in note-taking.</p>
      <div class="icons">
         <h3> <i class="fas fa-check"></i>  <span style="color: gold;">Point 1</span> <p>Several studies have shown that laptop note-takers perform worse on conceptual exam questions compared to longhand note-takers (Mueller & Oppenheimer, 2014). The studies also reveal that even though students can type more on their laptops, they tend to simply transcribe the lecture verbatim. This robs them of the opportunity to process and grasp information in such a way that they can reframe it in their own words, unlike when writing notes on paper.</p></h3>

<h3> <i class="fas fa-check"></i>   <span style="color: gold;">Point 2</span><p>The results of the studies can be likened to learning impairment. Essentially, the students hear and capture the lecture’s content. However, they might not be able to absorb and digest it effectively. Because of this, they are left with notes that may include facts, but without conclusions drawn from the lecture. As a result, they find it a challenge to answer conceptual and open-ended questions.</p> </h3>
